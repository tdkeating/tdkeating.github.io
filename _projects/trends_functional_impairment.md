This is an independent research study of longitudinal data exploring the trends in functional impairment over time, and whether this differs between racial groups. This study uses a marginal model with generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for correlated data, and performs a sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for missing data. 

It is based on data from the [Americans' Changing Lives (ACL)](https://acl.isr.umich.edu/for-researchers/) survey series.
