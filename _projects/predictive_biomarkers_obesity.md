This is a group research study which builds a predictive model for obesity by incorporating biomarkers in addition to body mass index (BMI). Some of the statistical methods used are cross-validation, LASSO regression, and ridge regression. It is based on data from the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).
