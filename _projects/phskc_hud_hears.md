Public Health, Seattle and King County (PHSKC)

This is a research study at PHSKC in the Assessment, Policy Development, and Evaluation Unit on a Housing and Urban Development- Health, Employment, and Residential Stability project. PHSKC is partnered with both King County Housing Authority (KCHA) and Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) on this project.

The project involved designing and implementing a study to evaluate how different types of exits from public housing assistance programs are associated with housing stability and economic outcomes. The study uses propensity scores, inverse probability treatment weighting, and Cox proportional hazards models to explore the association between type of exit and time to homelessness. Lastly, a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis is performed on the exit reasons in the study. 

It is based on data from the housing authorities (KCHA and SHA), Medicaid, Behavioral Health Recovery Division, Homeless Management Information System, Health Care for the Homeless Network, and Puget Sound Regional Council Opportunity Mapping.
