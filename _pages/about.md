I am a first year MSc student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I completed my Bachelor of Science from McGill University in 2018, with a major in mathematics and a minor in chemistry. Following my undergraduate degree, I worked in several industries and realized that my passion was in solving problems for clients, customers, and businesses. I decided to return to school and develop my skills in statistics, so that I can create insights and solutions in health, education, and transportation.
